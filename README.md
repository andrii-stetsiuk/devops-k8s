## Kubernetes Manifest Prompt Portfolio

| NAME | PROMPT | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| app.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Deployment named "go-demo-app" with 2 replicas running the container image "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" exposing containerPort 8080, and a ClusterIP Service named "go-demo-app" mapping port 80 to targetPort 8080. Use labels app=go-demo-app everywhere. Output valid Kubernetes YAML only. If analyzing an existing manifest, first list issues/gaps and their impact, then provide a corrected YAML. | Baseline Deployment + Service for the Go demo app. | [yaml/app.yaml](yaml/app.yaml) |
| app-livenessProbe.yaml | Generate a Deployment named "go-demo-app-liveness" (labels app=go-demo-app) with 2 replicas of "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" exposing 8080. Add a livenessProbe using HTTP GET on path "/healthz" port 8080 with initialDelaySeconds 5, periodSeconds 10, failureThreshold 3. Output valid YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Demonstrates container livenessProbe configuration. | [yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-readinessProbe.yaml | Generate a Deployment named "go-demo-app-readiness" (labels app=go-demo-app) with 2 replicas of "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" exposing 8080. Add a readinessProbe using HTTP GET on path "/readyz" port 8080 with initialDelaySeconds 5, periodSeconds 10, successThreshold 1, failureThreshold 3. Output valid YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Demonstrates container readinessProbe configuration. | [yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts.yaml | Generate: (1) ConfigMap "app-config" with key APP_MESSAGE, (2) PersistentVolumeClaim "app-pvc" (1Gi, RWO), and (3) Deployment "go-demo-app-volumes" (labels app=go-demo-app) with 1 replica of "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" that mounts the ConfigMap at "/etc/app/config" (readOnly) and the PVC at "/data". Output valid multi-document YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Demonstrates mounting a ConfigMap and a PVC into a Deployment. | [yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| app-cronjob.yaml | Generate a CronJob named "go-demo-app-cron" that runs every minute ("* * * * *"). The Job runs a container based on "curlimages/curl" executing: curl -fsS http://go-demo-app/healthz; restartPolicy OnFailure. Include minimal sensible history limits. Output valid YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Periodic health check against the app Service using a CronJob. | [yaml/app-cronjob.yaml](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| app-job.yaml | Generate a Job named "hello-job" with restartPolicy Never and backoffLimit 1 that runs "busybox" to print "Hello, Kubernetes!" and exit. Output valid YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | One-off batch Job example. | [yaml/app-job.yaml](yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| app-multicontainer.yaml | Generate a Pod named "go-demo-app-multicontainer" (labels app=go-demo-app) with two containers: (1) the app container "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" exposing 8080, and (2) a sidecar "busybox" tailing a shared log file. Use an emptyDir named "shared-logs" mounted at /var/log/app in both containers. Output valid YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Sidecar pattern with shared volume between containers. | [yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml](yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| app-resources.yaml | Generate a Deployment named "go-demo-app-resources" (labels app=go-demo-app) with 2 replicas of "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" exposing 8080. Configure container resources: requests cpu=100m, memory=128Mi; limits cpu=500m, memory=256Mi. Output valid YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Shows resource requests/limits best-practice defaults. | [yaml/app-resources.yaml](yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| app-secret-env.yaml | Generate: (1) Secret "app-secret" (Opaque) with keys DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD; (2) Deployment "go-demo-app-secret-env" (labels app=go-demo-app) using image "ghcr.io/den-vasyliev/go-demo-app:latest" that imports environment variables from this Secret using envFrom.secretRef. Output valid multi-document YAML only. For analysis, list issues first, then output a fixed YAML. | Demonstrates injecting env vars from a Secret into a Deployment. | [yaml/app-secret-env.yaml](yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
